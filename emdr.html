    <h2>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</h2>
    <p>
      EMDR is an evidence-based psychotherapy that helps people heal from trauma and distressing life experiences. It uses guided eye movements to help process and integrate difficult memories, reducing their emotional charge.
    </p>
    <h3>How Does EMDR Work?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifies troubling memories or beliefs.</li>
      <li>Processes these using bilateral stimulation (such as guided eye movements).</li>
      <li>Helps the brain reprocess the memory, reducing distress and enabling positive beliefs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Benefits of EMDR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Effective for trauma, PTSD, anxiety, grief, and more</li>
      <li>Does not require detailed discussion of the distressing event</li>
      <li>Often produces results more quickly than traditional therapy</li>
    </ul>
